# EdMedley

Description
EdMedley is a collection of educational minigames played in fast succession. They are targeted to a younger elementary school audience.

Requirements: Windows 10+

Playing the Game
To play the game, go into "dist" folder, then "main" folder, and scroll down and run "main.exe". The game will then run. 

Running from Source Files
The application is standalone but running any .py will require the latest Pygame version to be installed. If you want to run this application on a non Windows OS you must run the main.py file in the main directory. This will require you to have Python 3+ and the latest version of Pygame.
